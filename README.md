# web_scraping_mars
For this assignment, I performed web scraping and data analysis centered around Mars
# Part 1
I automated web browsing to collect titles and preview text from the Mars News website. Using Beautiful Soup, I parsed the HTML to extract the data, and stored it in Python dictionaries. Each dictionary includes 'title' and 'preview' keys, and is organized in the dictionaries within a Python list. 
# Part 2
I accessed Mars temperature data from a specific URL. Using Beautiful Soup, I extracted the data from an HTML table and transformed it into a Pandas DataFrame. I conducted a analysis on the mars data.
